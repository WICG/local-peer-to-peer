You should also know that...

We'd prefer the TAG provide feedback as (please delete all but the desired option):

üêõ open issues in our GitHub repo for **each point of feedback**

**Open points**

- Security and privacy have been a major focus when designing this API. We're eager to hear about any concerns in this area so it can be addressed appropriately.
- We would be in favor of a unification effort that aligns the DataChannel and WebTransport APIs across all transports (such as LP2P, WebRTC and HTTP/3).
- There is a question if a stricter CORS variant is warranted for local HTTPS sites [Tracking issue](https://github.com/WICG/local-peer-to-peer/issues/34)
- DataChannel vs WebTransport: should we keep both? [Tracking issue](https://github.com/WICG/local-peer-to-peer/issues/29)
- Adding the appropriate teardown/shutdown logic & events is pending. This will be addressed by studying president set by specs such as [WebRTC](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/) and [WebTransport](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/).

**Implementation experiments**

To help inform the API design, we are conducting a series of experiments to evaluate the feasibility of the design:

- [go-lp2p](https://github.com/backkem/go-lp2p): an experimental API implementation in Go.
- There is a WIP implementation of the Open Screen Protocol in [Chromium](https://chromium.googlesource.com/openscreen/). It is being upgraded to using [QUICHE](https://github.com/google/quiche) QUIC implementation. We intent to build a POC on top in the future.
